# Aran Bot

Bot for [the School Idol Festival Discord server](https://discord.gg/sif).

Note that this is the "private" part of Aran, as in, it is only used on SIFcord.  
The SIFAS Card/Song Lookup functions, which can be useful for other servers, are implemented
seperately as a different bot, so you can have it join your servers without all the extra stuff
in here. For info about that and the invite link, [check out the discord-sifaslookup repo](https://github.com/Suyooo/discord-sifaslookup/).

## Setup

If you want to run this yourself you need to:

* Run `npm install` to grab packages
* Set up configuration (see next section)
* Start the bot and dashboard with `npm start` or `node aran.js`

### Configuration

#### Secret (`config.secret.json`)

Application keys and tokens from the Discord Developer Portal.

* `clientId`
* `clientSecret`
* `botToken`

#### Global (`config.global.json`)

Configuring bot behaviour.

* `textCommandPrefix`: Messages must start with this prefix to be recognized as text commands.
* `sifcordGuildId`: Server ID for which server this bot should be running on. You probably want
  to change this to a test server's ID.
* `staffRoleId`: Role ID for the role that should be used for dashboard access control.

#### Local (`config.local.json`)

File that sets per-environment configuration (so I can deploy every other file from my local
environment directly to the server environment)

* `dashboardPort`: Which port the dashboard should run on.
* `dashboardRootPath` *(optional)*: If proxying through a webserver running on another port,
  this option allows you to set a subfolder so link URLs are set correctly, without a trailing
  slash (for example: `/dashboard`). If not set, it will be set to the root (empty string).
* `dashboardDomain` *(optional)*: If Express.JS resolves the domain name incorrectly (or the
  dashboard is proxied), this allows you to override it. Again, no trailing slash, and do not 
  include the root path if `dashboardRootPath` is set (for example: `https://example.com`).
* `mÌ€oduleWhitelist` *(optional)*: An array of strings that only allows those modules to be
  loaded. This allows you to run only one single module you are working on in your dev
  environment, while the rest of the bot can still run the rest without any conflicts. If not
  set, all modules in the `modules` folder will be loaded.

## Implementing Modules

To avoid having to mess with too much of the code, new functions can be implemented as modules.
Generally, feel free to check the `rolebuttons` module as an example of how to implement the
following components.

To create a new module, make a new subfolder in the `modules` folder with an `info.json` file in
it with the following keys:

* `description`: A human-readable description of what this module is or does.
* `textCommands` *(optional)*: An array of strings which the bot implements as commands. The text
  commands will be registered so the bot component can be called for them (see below). The strings
  should not include a command prefix symbol, as that is defined in the configuration. If this key
  is not defined, no text commands are registered.
* `dashboardTitle` *(optional)*: String for the link to the module's dashboard on the index. If
  this key is not defined, it will not be linked on the dashboard (for utility modules, or
  modules without dashboards)

### Objects

In the modules, you'll mainly be working with the bot and database objects to interact with the
server or store data. Here's what those have.

#### Bot Object

The Bot Object is generally just a [Discord.JS client object](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/14.0.3/class/Client),
so check those docs for what you can do with it. For example, if you want to add a listener to
general events (like `messageCreate` for all messages), you can do so by using the regular event
listening methods on the bot object (`bot.on("messageCreate", async message => {...})`).

Additionally, the following properties are added to it by Aran:

* `bot.modules`: Access to all loaded bot components. The property keys are the module names (as
  in the subfolder names). Using this, you can access your bot component's methods from your
  dashboard component, or access functions offered by helper modules.
* `bot.auth`: Authentication helper. Can be used on bot components to check whether the calling
  user is Staff, or on dashboard components to check whether the logged-in user is Staff. (It
  technically works like any other module, but we give it a special place and make sure it is
  loaded first.)
* `bot.cron`: You can call this method to schedule functions to be executed at certain times.
  `pattern` is a cron schedule expression, so you can use tools like https://crontab.guru/ to get
  one. The method returns a [CronJob object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) you can store and
  use to stop the job. Note that schedules don't carry over on restarts - if you need persistent
  scheduled functions, store them in the database and re-schedule them when the module gets
  initialized.

#### Database Object

`// TODO`

### Bot Component

Bot components can use the Discord.JS client to interact with the Discord server to send
messages, look up channels/roles/users/etc. and so on. It is optional to have a bot component.

The bot component is implemented in the `bot.js` file in the module folder's root. It must export
a function that takes the bot and database objects as parameters, and returns an object with any
number of the following methods:

* `async textCommand(message, args)`: Is called if a registered text command with the command
  prefix from the configuration is sent in a channel the bot is in. `args` is the message
  content split at spaces.
* `async button(interaction, args)`: Receives a button message component interaction from
  Discord.JS. `args` is the interaction ID split at hyphens.
* `async selection(interaction, args)`: Receives a select menu message component interaction
  from Discord.JS. `args` is the interaction ID split at hyphens.
* `async modal(interaction, args)`: Receives a modal submission from Discord.JS. `args` is the
  interaction ID split at hyphens.
* Any number of utility methods that can be used by the bot or other components as you like

If you want to use a database to store configuration, you should make sure it gets automatically
created if the database file does not exist yet.

#### Regarding Message Component Interactions

If you use Discord's message components, like buttons and select menus, make sure their ID
starts with your module's name and a hyphen. The main bot uses this prefix to route component
interactions to the correct module. So, for example, for a module in the folder `rolebuttons`,
all message component IDs must start with `rolebuttons-`.

Anything after that prefix can be whatever you want, to identify the button/menu or to carry
information or a state, as long as you stay below Discord's 100-character limit.

### Dashboard Component

Dashboard components are loaded into the frontend, so you can manage settings and such from a
browser instead of having to use chat commands. It is optional to have a dashboard component.

The dashboard component is implemented in the `dashboard.js` file in the module folder's root.
It must export a function taking the bot and database objects as parameters, and export an
Express.JS router, which will be served at the `/modulename/` URL of the dashboard. You
probably want to implement some kind of index page since that is what the module index will
link to. However, you are not forced to - if you, for example, create a utility module that is
only used by other modules for data interchange, you can only implement those routes, and
declare in the `info.json` file that there is no dashboard for your module.

If you want to limit access to the dashboard, make sure to use one of the middlewares from
`bot.auth`, like `router.use(bot.auth.mustBeStaff);`. You can create a `views` subfolder in your
module folder to add EJS templates to use (make sure to include the header/footer). You can also
create a `static` folder for resources used by the dashboard. The `js`, `style` and `vendor`
folders will be served by Express.JS at the `/js/modulename/`, `/style/modulename/` and
`/vendor/modulename/` URLs of the dashboard server.
